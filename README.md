# Horse-Race-Question
Work in your Capstone Teams to code the solution with an output that reads “[Horse’s Name] averaged [ x ] mph across the three triple crown races.   American Pharaoh won the Triple Crown.  He won the Belmont, a 12 furlong track, with a time of 2:26.65, the Kentucky Derby, a 10 furlong track, with a time of 2:03.02, and the Preakness Stakes, a 9.5 furlong track, with a time of 1.58.46.  What was his average speed in mph?



reply = input('Give the name of a famous race horse:')


A_Phar_avg_mph = (( (12/8)/(146.65/3600)) + ((10/8)/(123.02/3600)) + ((9.5/8)/(118.46/3600))/ 3
                 
                 
print(reply + 'averaged'+ str(A_Phar_avg_mph) + 'mph across the three triple crown races')
